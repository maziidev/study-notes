# study-notes - maziidev

This repository contains my personal study notes and documentation as I progress through my journey of mastering
- Backend development
- Cybersecurity
- AI/ML
- Web3/blockchain
- Frontend development
- Mathematics.

Inside, you'll find well-organized notes on each topic that I am studying, including key concepts, theories, and technical details. These notes are a collection of my learnings, references, and summaries of important topics that I encounter throughout my learning journey.

The structure is divided into different subjects, and I update it regularly as I learn and build hands-on projects. These notes are meant for personal reference and are shared to help others who may be on a similar path.

Feel free to explore and contribute any suggestions or improvements you think could help enhance the content.
