# Part 2: Node.js Learning Roadmap

1. Introduction to Node.js

What is Node.js?

Understanding the architecture of Node.js.

Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

Differences between Node.js and traditional web servers (like Apache).

Setting up Node.js:

Installing Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

Understanding Node.js runtime environment.

Exploring the package.json file.

2. Node.js Basics

Node.js Core Modules:

fs (File System): Reading, writing, and managing files.

http and https: Creating web servers.

path: Working with file and directory paths.

events: Using event emitters.

stream: Handling data streams.

Understanding npm (Node Package Manager):

Installing and managing dependencies with npm.

package.json basics: scripts, dependencies, devDependencies.

Managing package versions and updating packages.

Building a Simple HTTP Server:

Creating a basic server using http.createServer().

Handling routes, headers, and request/response objects.

3. Asynchronous Programming in Node.js

Callbacks:

Understanding callbacks and the callback hell problem.

Promises:

Converting callback-based functions to promises.

Using .then(), .catch(), and .finally().

Async/Await:

Writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style using async and await.

4. Express.js Framework (Most Popular Node.js Framework)

Introduction to Express.js:

Setting up an Express.js server.

Handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Route handling and middleware.

Using req and res objects to interact with HTTP requests and responses.

Middlewares:

Understanding middleware and how it works.

Using built-in middleware (e.g., express.json()).

Creating custom middleware for logging, authentication, etc.

Routing:

Using Express Router for modular route handling.

Template Engines (optional):

Using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars with Express.

5. Working with Databases

Introduction to Databases:

SQL vs. NoSQL databases.

Working with MongoDB (NoSQL Database):

Setting up MongoDB with Node.js.

Installing and using mongoose for MongoDB interactions.

Creating schemas and models.

Working with SQL Databases:

Introduction to SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Using sequelize ORM to interact with SQL databases.

6. Building RESTful APIs

What is a RESTful API?

Principles of REST (Representational State Transfer).

RESTful routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Creating a REST API with Express:

Building endpoints for CRUD operations.

Structuring the API.

API Security:

Implementing authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Using middleware for authorization.

API Validation and Error Handling:

Using express-validator for input validation.

Proper error handling in APIs.

7. Advanced Node.js Concepts

File Handling and Streams:

Understanding streams (readable, writable, transform streams).

Implementing file uploads.

Event-Driven Architecture:

Using EventEmitter in Node.js.

Building event-driven applications.

Clustering and Load Balancing:

Using Node.js clustering to handle multiple processes for better scalability.

Caching:

Using caching mechanisms (like Redis) to improve application performance.

8. Testing and Debugging in Node.js

Unit Testing:

Using testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, and Jest for writing tests.

Writing unit tests for your Node.js app.

Debugging Node.js Applications:

Using node --inspect for debugging.

Utilizing VS Codeâ€™s debugging tools.

9. Deploying Node.js Applications

Deployment Platforms:

Deploying Node.js applications to Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, or Google Cloud.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):

Setting up pipelines for automated testing and deployment using services like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

## Part 3: Full-stack Development with TypeScript and Node.js

1. Full-Stack Setup

Combining TypeScript with Node.js.

Setting up a TypeScript-based Node.js server.

Using TypeORM for database interaction in a TypeScript-based Node.js app.

2. Building Real Applications

Building a CRUD Application:

Build a simple task manager application (with MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

Implement authentication and user management.

Building a Real-Time Chat Application:

Using WebSockets (Socket.IO) for real-time communication.

Integrating Frontend and Backend:

Building a frontend (React or Angular) and connecting it to your Node.js backend.

Fetching data from the backend API and displaying it on the frontend.
