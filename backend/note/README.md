# INTRO TO BACKEND DEVELOPMENT [BE - DEV]

Backedn development is a part of software development that focus on building the server-sides of web applications.
Backend deals with everything that happens behind the scenes - when a user interacts with an application (web or mobile).
Backend development is concerned with how data is handled, processed and stored on the server.

Backend developers are responsible for managing server, databases, and application logic that users do not directly see but rely on for the app to function correctly.

## WHAT IS BACKEND DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR

- server- side logic: the brain of the application. process users req, performs computations and returns response to the user
- Database: for storing and organiing all the data used by the application
- APIs: allows differnet software system to communicate with each other
- Authentication and authorization: authentication deals with verifying the identity of users and authorization checking if users are allowed to do what they are doing.
- security: paramount in backend. A backend developer must implement features like data encryption, and protection against SQL injectins and cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure the user data is protected.

## COMPONENTS OF A BACKEND APPLICATION

- Server: the computer or system that listens for incoming requests and responds to them
- Database: stores data that is fetched, modified and updated by the application.
- server-side programming languages: Javascript(nodejs), python, ruby, php, GO

NB: Backend development deals with handing business logic as well.
